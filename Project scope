PROJECT SCOPE:

# Project Justification: The development of the Mobile Health (mHealth) Checklist App for
Rheumatoid Arthritis Management is a critical initiative aimed at enhancing the
quality of life for individuals living with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This
project is justified by the need for a personalized, accessible tool that can assist
patients in tracking their daily health activities, managing their medication
schedules, and accessing educational content about RA. The mHealth app will
serve as a companion for RA patients, providing them with actionable insights
and the convenience of managing their condition through their mobile devices.
The integration of this technology with Electronic Health Records (EHR) will
ensure a seamless care experience, while the adherence to healthcare regulations
like HIPAA will guarantee the security and privacy of patient data.

# Product Description: The mHealth Checklist App will be a comprehensive, cross-platform application
designed to provide RA patients with a daily management toolkit. It will feature
medication reminders, symptom tracking, and the ability to log physical
activities and dietary intake. The app will also include a library of resources to
educate patients about RA and its management. Designed with user experience
in mind, the app will ensure easy navigation and interaction, making RA
management more accessible and less burdensome.

# Project Deliverables: 
⮚ A cross-platform mHealth Checklist App tailored for RA management.
⮚ Daily health management tools for tracking symptoms, medications, and
lifestyle adjustments.
⮚ Data security measures that comply with HIPAA and other healthcare
regulations.
⮚ A library of educational content focused on RA.
⮚ Integration with EHR systems for up-to-date patient health information.
Out-of-scope Items: ⮚ Features unrelated to RA management.
⮚ Provision of hardware or other IT infrastructure not directly related to
the app's functionality.
⮚ Overhauling existing EHR systems beyond the requirements for
integration with the app.

# Project Objectives: 
➢ Create an engaging and supportive digital environment for RA patients
to manage their condition.
➢ Enhance the patient-provider communication channel through the app's
reporting features.
➢ Provide a tool that is easily adaptable to individual patient needs and
treatment plans.
➢ The tool will facilitate symptom and medication tracking, provide
educational content, and ensure seamless integration with EHRs, all
while prioritizing user experience and data security.
Cost Objectives An investment of $155,000 will cater to all project stages from assessment and
design to implementation, testing, and deployment, ensuring the delivery of a
cost-effective and high-quality mobile health application within the allocated
budget.

# Schedule Objectives 
1. Initial Assessment and Planning (02/02/2024 - 02/10/2024): Begin with
gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders, establishing the project's
scope, and outlining a comprehensive project plan.
2. Design and Prototyping (02/11/2024 - 02/25/2024): Develop the app's
design, focusing on user interface and experience, and create a prototype for
initial user testing.
3. Development (02/26/2024 - 03/18/2024): Engage in active development of
the app, incorporating feedback from the prototyping phase and building out the
primary features and functionalities.
4. Testing and Refinement (03/19/2024 - 04/02/2024): Perform extensive
testing, including user acceptance and security tests, to ensure the app's
reliability and effectiveness. Refine the app based on feedback.
5. Launch and Evaluation (04/03/2024 - 04/24/2024): Officially release the app
on both iOS and Android platforms, monitor its performance, and gather user
feedback for future improvements.

# Acceptance Criteria
1.Comprehensive Functionality: The app must include key features
such as medication tracking, symptom logging, and customizable
health checklists, as outlined in the project requirements.
2.User Experience and Accessibility: The app should be intuitive and
easy to navigate for RA patients, ensuring high usability with a clear,
accessible interface design.
3.Reliable Performance and Integration: The app must perform
consistently and integrate seamlessly with existing Electronic Health
Records (EHR) systems without technical issues.
4. Data Security and Compliance: All personal health information
within the app must be securely encrypted, and the app must be in
full compliance with HIPAA regulations.
5. Positive User Feedback: After the launch, the app should receive
positive feedback from most of its user base, confirming that it meets
the needs and expectations of RA patients and healthcare providers.

# Constraints: 
1.Budgetary Constraints: The project must not exceed the allocated
budget of $155,000, which requires careful resource management
and prioritization of features.
2. Time Constraints: Completion of all project phases must adhere
to the specified timeline, with the project launch scheduled for no
later than 04/24/2024.
3. Scope Constraints: The project is limited to features and
functionalities that specifically support Rheumatoid Arthritis
management. Any scope creep involving unrelated functionalities
must be avoided.
4. Technical Constraints: The app must be compatible across both
iOS and Android platforms, requiring cross-platform technology that
may limit certain features or designs.
5.Regulatory Constraints: The app must comply with healthcare
regulations, such as HIPAA in the United States, which govern the
security and privacy of patient health information.
6.Quality Constraints: The final product must meet predefined
quality standards, ensuring that the app is reliable, effective, and
user-friendly for RA patients.

# Assumptions: 
1. Stakeholder Engagement: Key stakeholders, such as RA patients
and healthcare providers, will be actively involved and provide
essential feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
2. Resource Availability: Required skilled personnel and technological
resources will be consistently available to support the project's
development and implementation phases.
3. User Adoption: The target user base, RA patients, will be receptive
to adopting the app and integrating it into their daily health
management routines.
4. Regulatory Compliance: The app will maintain compliance with
healthcare regulations such as HIPAA throughout the project, with
no significant changes to regulatory standards expected.
5. Budget Sufficiency: The allocated budget of $155,000 will be
adequate to cover all necessary development, testing, and
deployment activities to deliver a fully functional app.
